    <h2> Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop
        computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft
        software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows
        Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.

        Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code
        refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. Other
        built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer,
        and database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including
        adding support for source control systems (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets like editors and
        visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development
        lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).</h2>
